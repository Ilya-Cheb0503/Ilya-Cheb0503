# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a **Python Backend Developer** with 3+ years of experience in building scalable and high-performance solutions. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills to solve real-world problems through programming. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and creating solutions that add true value to businesses.

I started my journey into IT during university, where I quickly realized that programming is my true passion. Since then, I've worked on a wide variety of projects, from freelance to team-based collaboration, and continuously aimed to grow both professionally and personally.

# üî• Latest Project: **Telegram Bots for Job Search**

I have developed and deployed **5 Telegram bots** for various companies that aggregate job vacancies and display them in a user-friendly format within Telegram. These bots fetch job listings from APIs and from websites (where APIs are unavailable) through custom parsers I developed. I also implemented personalized features for each client based on their specific requests, such as the ability to submit resumes directly via the bot.

The bot stack includes:

* **Async Programming (aiohttp, aiohttp, SQLAlchemy)**
* **Telegram API (python-telegram-bot)**
* **Cloud Hosting & Deployments (Docker, Nginx)**

This project has allowed me to expand my skills in working with **asynchronous programming**, **API integration**, and **cloud services**, and I continue to improve the user experience with new features and optimizations.
